    "# üìä Workspace for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either JupyterLab or VisualStudio Code through your browser to access the workspace, switch to VSCode by clicking on its button on the JupyterLab Launcher page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `persistent` folder in the workspace to store data and code persistently. Note that on some system, like the DSRI, it is slower to read and write data in this folder. So you might want to use another folder in the workspace for faster read/write. The data stored in other folders will be lost if the notebook container is restarted or stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì•Ô∏è Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend to store the dependencies you install in files in the `persistent` folder (e.g. `env.yml`, `requirements.txt`), and to have a `install.sh` script in the persistent folder to reinstall everything easily in case the container is restarted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### üêç Install conda packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `conda` or `mamba` to install conda packages. Mamba is a reimplementation of conda in C++ that makes it much faster, every commands used in conda work in mamba, you just need to replace conda by mamba at the start of the command. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è If `mamba` does not work for you, then use `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use a different python version than the one used by default in the container you can create a new environment with the python version you need. Note that you will be able to easily start notebooks using installed conda environments from the JupyterLab Launcher page if you install `nb_conda_kernels` and `ipykernel` in the new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to use python 3.6 a new env named `py36`, your `env.yml` should look like this, you can add more conda and pip packages to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: py36\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",
    "  - anaconda\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - python=3.6\n",
    "  - ipykernel \n",
    "  - nb_conda_kernels\n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add more `pip` packages by adding this to the dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  - pip:\n",
    "    - your-pip-package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your environment has been defined, you can create it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba env create -f env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A new tile to create a notebook with your custom conda environment should appear after a minute in the JupyterLab launcher page.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot use `conda activate` in a Docker container, so you will need to either open a notebook using the kernel for your conda env, or use `conda run` to run scripts in the new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba run -n py36 python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üêç Install pip packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python packages with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶Ô∏è Install apt packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If `sudo` has been enabled in the container you can install packages with the `apt` package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install -y wget\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
